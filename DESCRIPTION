Description: A set of tools for calculating various urban morphological parameters in R.
   The toolset is intended to be used for multicore computation so that
   we can analyse spatial datasets for large cities and metro areas.
   It is inspired by Morpho (Oliveira, 2013) and other works on urban form
   and urban morphology. It is in the very early stages of development,
   and I am a first timer package developer, so do not expect everything
   to work correctly and bug-free.
