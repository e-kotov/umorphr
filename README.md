# umorphr

A set of tools for calculating various urban morphological parameters in
R. The toolset is intended to be used for multicore computation so that
we can analyse spatial datasets for large cities and metro areas. It is
inspired by Morpho (Oliveira, 2013) and other works on urban form and
urban morphology. It is in the very early stages of development, and I
am a first timer package developer, so do not expect everything to work
correctly and bug-free.

## Installation

The package has not yet been tested and is not ready for installation,
however you can use the .R files from the R folder and simply source
them to use the functions.

After the first alpha release you will be able to install the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("e-kotov/umorphr")
```
